bin/dataprocessor
============

Including directory and files
--------------

- README: This file
- manip1.json: sample json file for dataprocessor
- datadir: sample dirctory for dataprocessor
  - datadir/project1/run01/parameters.conf: run parameter file
  - datadir/project1/run03/parameters.conf: run parameter file
  - datadir/project2/run01/parameters.ini: run parameter file
  - datadir/project2/run02/parameters.ini: run parameter file
  - datadir/project2/run03/parameters.conf: run parameter file


Usage (Supposed that current directory is the same as this file)
--------
Create json file of meta information "data\_information.json".

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip1.json

Read data\_information.json and add configure and save to newdata.json

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip2.json

Read data\_information.json and add comment and save to newdata.json
Please change "/path/to/node" in "manip3.json" such as "${PWD}/datadir/project1/run01".

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip3.json


bin/server.py (for webapp)
==========================

See also help generated by the following commands:

    $ ../bin/server.py -h
    $ ../bin/server.py start -h

*CAUTION*
The server listen a port.
It may cause a security problem.
Usually, firewalls prevent to access the server from other computers.
If you want to use server from another computer,
you can use SSH port forwarding.

Install
-------

In order to use webapp, a JavaScript library `jQuery` is necessary.
It can be download by the following script:

    $ ../bin/server.py install

Then the library code is downloaded into `../server/js/`.

Start server
------------

Since the main objective of the webapp is browsing and managing data,
the server should know where your data is saved.
This webapp and server suppose that the data is saved into a JSON file.
In order to save data into a JSON file,
see `manip1.json` and other samples described above.
If you use `data_information.json` generated by `manip1.json`,

    $ ../bin/server.py start ./data_information.json --port 8080

Then the server starts on `localhost:8080`.
You can access to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` by your web-browser.

See also the help

    $ ../bin/server.py start help

stop server
-----------

The following command stops the server.
   $ ../bin/server.py stop


bin/register_figure
=================

identifier of figure
--------------------
In DataProcessor, figures are managed as nodes in `node_list`.
The executable script `register_figure` registers your figure.
Then the figure is copied into `figure_directory`;
if `fig1.png` is registered, it will be copied into
`figure_directory/<hash hexdigits>/fig1.png`.
`<hash hexdigits>` is a SHA-1 hash value of `fig1.png`.
This is the id of the figure.

Add a figure node
-----------------
To add a figure node into node_list,
you must specify

- `figure_directory` into where the figures are copied
- `json_file` which contains `node_list`

In this sample, you should use `./figure` as `figure_directory`,
and `./data_information.json` as `json_file`.
Then the register command becomes as follows:

    $ mkdir figures
    $ ../bin/register_figure ./figures ./data_information.json datadir/project1/run01/fig1.png -g datadir/project1/run01/fig1.gp
