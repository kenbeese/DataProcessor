  - datadir/project1/run01/parameters.conf: run parameter file
  - datadir/project1/run03/parameters.conf: run parameter file
  - datadir/project2/run01/parameters.ini: run parameter file

Usage (Supposed that current directory is the same as this file)
--------
Create json file of mete information "data\_information.json".

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip1.json

Create html file from data\_information.json.

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip2.json  # Read meta information and transform html

Read data\_information.json and add configure and save to newdata.json

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip3.json

Read data\_information.json and add comment and save to newdata.json
Please change "/path/to/node" in "manip4.json" such as "${PWD}/datadir/project1/run01".

    $ ../bin/dataprocessor ./manip4.json


bin/server.py (for webapp)
==========================

See also help generated by the following commands:

    $ ../bin/server.py -h
    $ ../bin/server.py start -h

*CAUTION*
The server listen a port.
It may cause a security problem.
Usually, firewalls prevent to access the server from other computers.
If you want to use server from another computer,
you can use SSH port forwarding.

Install
-------

In order to use webapp, a JavaScript library `jQuery` is necessary.
It can be download by the following script:

    $ ../bin/server.py install

Then the library code is downloaded into `../server/js/`.

start server
------------

Since the main objective of the webapp is browsing and managing data,
the server should know where your data is saved.
This webapp and server suppose that the data is saved into a JSON file.
In order to save data into a JSON file,
see `manip1.json` and other samples described above.
If you use `data_information.json` generated by `manip1.json`,

    $ ../bin/server.py start ./data_information.json --port 8080

Then the server starts on `localhost:8080`.
You can access to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` by your web-browser.
